## FPGA Chess Game

This project implements a chess game on the Cyclone V FPGA. It utilizes a VGA display to render the chessboard and a PS2 mouse for user input, allowing players to make moves by clicking on the board. The game features audio feedback for various actions, such as placing a piece, promoting a pawn, castling, and the start and end of the game.

### Key Features:
- VGA display for board visualization
- PS2 mouse input for user interaction
- Audio feedback for different game events
- Implementation of all legal and uncommon chess moves
- Handling of edge cases like en passant, promotion, stalemate, and draw

This project aims to provide a comprehensive chess-playing experience on FPGA, combining hardware and software to create a fully functional chess game.
